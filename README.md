# Company Website: Server Side Rendering

A Server Side Pre-Rendered Company Website build using NextJs

## Features

- all pages are server side rendered
- app is fetching data from a JSON server hosted on Github [here](https://github.com/ialtafshaikh/static-files/tree/master/json)
- bootsrap is used to layout and design the pages and components
- app make use of sass and css
- nextjs app is hosted on **Vercel**


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository into your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/ialtafshaikh/nextjs-company-ssr.git
```
Secondly, install all the dependencies
```
npm i
```

then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
